Sun Gang received the B.Eng. degree in Automation from Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2021. I received the M.Eng. degree in Control Science and Engineering from Dalian University of Technology. I am currently pursuing a Doctor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence with the Intelligent Robot Lab at Dalian University of Technology. My current research interests include motion planning, perception-aware planning.
